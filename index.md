<b style="color:rgb(247, 22, 105);">About Me: </b> I work mainly on recommender systems, text datasets, and document clustering. Inside me, there is a mysterious connection to the math behind the machine learning algorithms. Curiosity pushed me to learner algorithms and AI world, and as I found my passion about it, I have been trying to know how they work and how they will be better.<br/>
These days, in addition to research, I have started a journey to learn how to deploy machine learning models in web applications. To this end, react.js, flask, node.js are my new friends!<br/>
I am book addicted, and I am currently reading these two books:
- [Speech and Language Processing](https://www.amazon.com/Speech-Language-Processing-Daniel-Jurafsky/dp/0131873210)
- [Natural Language Processing with PyTorch](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-PyTorch-Applications/dp/1491978236/ref=pd_sbs_18/145-9588523-3399417?pd_rd_w=iaFuT&pf_rd_p=180628c6-6f13-4dbf-9213-f09cdedc7815&pf_rd_r=RQ1PJAF52HZ2HHHHV986&pd_rd_r=6db67402-d2d9-4145-94b8-ea82f5fd237b&pd_rd_wg=UCVxD&pd_rd_i=1491978236&psc=1)


Interests: Natural Language Processing, Recommender systems, Developing react web applications Powered by AI

My tools and lovely friends: python, javascript, react, numpy, sklearn, Pytorch, Keras, flask
